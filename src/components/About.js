        <p className="intro">
          This dashboard tracks Michigan's progress identifying and replacing lead service lines—the pipes that connect water mains to homes and buildings. Lead exposure through drinking water poses serious health risks, particularly for children.

        <section className="about-section">
          <h2>Regulatory Context</h2>
          <p>
            Michigan revised its Lead and Copper Rule in 2018, requiring all community water systems to inventory their service line materials and replace lead lines. The new sampling protocol took effect in 2019. The federal Lead and Copper Rule Improvements (2024) mandates full replacement nationwide by 2037.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Action Level Exceedances:</strong> Water systems that exceed the lead action level (15 parts per billion from 2019–2024; 10 parts per billion starting in 2025) face additional monitoring, public communication, and accelerated replacement requirements.
