# Michigan Lead Service Line Replacement Dashboard

An interactive data visualization tracking lead service line replacement progress across Michigan water systems (2021-2024).

**A collaboration between [Planet Detroit](https://planetdetroit.org) and [Safe Water Engineering](https://safewaterengineering.com)**

## Overview

This dashboard visualizes data from Michigan's Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) showing:
* **580,030** total lead service lines requiring replacement
* **69,891** lines replaced (12% progress) from 2021-2024
* **3.9 million** Michigan residents served by systems with known lead lines
* **138% increase** in replacement rates from 2021 to 2024

## Key Features

* **CSS3** - Styling and responsive design
* **PapaParse** - CSV data processing
* **GitHub Pages** - Hosting and deployment

## Data Source & Methodology

### Source Data
Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE):
* Community Drinking Supply Monitoring Inventory (CDSMI)
* Lead Service Line Replacement Reports (2021-2024)
* Lead Action Level Exceedance data

### Data Processing & Calculations

**Replacement progress percentages and compliance determinations are calculated by Planet Detroit** based on EGLE-reported data:

* **Total to Replace** = Lead lines + GPCL (Galvanized Previously Connected to Lead) + Unknown material lines
* **% Replaced** = (Lines Replaced / Total to Replace) × 100
* **Compliance Status**: 
  - **Compliant**: ≥20% replacement progress (meets regulatory requirement)
  - **Not in compliance**: <20% replacement progress

The dashboard uses raw data from EGLE's official reports, with replacement percentages and compliance assessments calculated by Planet Detroit to provide comprehensive analysis of statewide progress toward eliminating lead service lines.

### Regulatory Context

* **20% Compliance Threshold**: Michigan's regulatory framework establishes 20% replacement progress as a key benchmark for water system compliance
* **Lead and Copper Rule (LCR)**: Revised in 2018 to strengthen protections and accelerate lead service line replacement
* **Action Level Exceedances**: Water systems that exceed the lead action level (15 parts per billion) face additional monitoring and replacement requirements

## Installation & Development

### Prerequisites
* Node.js (v14 or higher)
* npm
* Git

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ninaplanetdetroit/lead-dashboard.git
cd lead-dashboard

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm start
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:3000`

### Data Updates

To update the dashboard with new EGLE data:

1. **Replace** `lead-data.csv` with updated CSV file from EGLE
2. **Run** the conversion script:
   ```bash
   node scripts/convertCsv.js
   ```
3. **Review** the generated `src/data/waterSystemsData.js`
4. **Test** locally:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
5. **Deploy** to GitHub Pages:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run deploy
   ```

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Deploy to GitHub Pages

```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Data Fields Tracked

For each water system, the dashboard displays:

* **PWSID** - Public Water System ID (unique identifier)
* **Supply Name** - Water system name
* **Population Served** - Residents served (2025 estimates)
* **Lead in CDSMI** - Known lead service lines
* **GPCL in CDSMI** - Galvanized Previously Connected to Lead lines
* **Unknown in CDSMI** - Lines with unknown material composition
* **Total to Replace** - Sum of lead + GPCL + unknown lines
* **Grand Total of Lead Service Lines Replaced** - Lines replaced (2021-2024)
* **% Replaced to Date** - Calculated replacement progress (by Planet Detroit)
* **Most Recent Lead Action Level Exceedance** - Year of most recent exceedance (if any)

## Key Insights from the Data

* **Scale of Challenge**: Over half a million service lines need replacement statewide
* **Progress Acceleration**: Replacement rates more than doubled from 2021 to 2024, showing increasing momentum
* **Population Impact**: 52.8% of Michigan's population is served by water systems with known lead lines
* **Unknown Materials**: 315,372 service lines still need material identification - representing a critical data gap
* **Compliance Landscape**: The 20% replacement threshold provides a clear benchmark for evaluating system progress
* **LCR Impact**: Michigan's 2018 Lead and Copper Rule revision established stricter requirements driving replacement efforts
